Note: We can use more command to display one screen of output at a time. Here use /E option and pass the other command output to more command using | (pipe) symbol.
	Example: C:> dir | more/E
Questions:
1.Display the following for ip address 127.0.0.1 or any other ip address
a.Scan open ports (syntax: nmap –open ip_address / url )

b.Scan single port (syntax: nmap -p 80 ip_address)

c.Scan specified range of ports (syntax: nmap -p 1-200 ip_address)

d.Scan entire port range (syntax: nmap -p 1-65535 ip_address)

e.Scan top 100 ports (fast scan) (syntax:  nmap -F ip_address )

B.Network scanning:
Nmap Tool: 
Nmap is also used to scan networks. Nmap is now one of the core tools used by network administrators to map their networks. The program can be used to find live hosts on a network, perform port scanning, ping sweeps, OS detection, and version detection.

Questions:
a.Demonstrate how to scan networks. Explain the steps and attach output.
1.Ping Scan – It returns a list of hosts on your network and the total number of assigned IP addresses. If you spot any hosts or IP addresses on this list that you cannot account for, you can then run further commands to investigate them further. 		Syntax: nmap  -sP   <ip_address>

2.Host Scan – Unlike a ping scan, a host scan actively sends ARP request packets to all the hosts connected to your network. Each host then responds to this packet with another ARP packet containing its status and MAC address. This can be a powerful way of spotting suspicious hosts connected to your network.
		Syntax: nmap  -sP   <target IP range>

3.If you see anything unusual in this list, you can then run a DNS query on a specific host, by using:
		Syntax: namp -sL <IP address>

This returns a list of names associated with the scanned IP. This description provides information on what the IP is actually for.
4.OS Scan – This command return information on the OS (and version) of a host. 
		Syntax: nmap  -O  <target IP>


More options to try:
1.Scan ip address which passes from text file (syntax : nmap –iL <filename.txt>)
2.Aggressive scanning (syntax : nmap –A <ip_address>)
3.To trace the route of destination address (syntax : nmap - - traceroute  <ip_address>)

C.Intrusion Detection:
Snort IDS Tool:
Snort is a free open source network intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS). Snort IPS uses a series of rules that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and generates alerts for users.
Snort can be configured in three main modes: 
1.Sniffer Mode: The program will read network packets and display them on the console.
2.Packet Logger Mode: The program will log packets to the disk.
3.Network Intrusion Detection System Mode: The program will monitor network traffic and analyze it against a rule set defined by the user. The program will then perform a specific action based on what has been identified.

Questions:
a.How snort works. Explain with steps and demonstrate various modes of snort.
Steps to defend your network with Snort for Windows:
Snort should be a dedicated computer in your network.  This computer’s logs should be reviewed often to see malicious activities on your network.
1. Download Snort from the Snort.org website.
2.  Download Rules from Snort.org website. You must register to get the rules. (You should download these often) https://snort.org/downloads
3.  Double click on the .exe to install snort.  This will install snort in the “C:\Snort” folder.
It is important to have npcap or WinPcap installed
4.  Extract the Rules file. You will need WinRAR for the .gz file.
5.  Copy all files from the “rules” folder of the extracted folder.  Now paste the rules into 		“C:\Snort\rules” folder.
6.Copy “snort.conf” file from the “etc” folder of the extracted folder.  You must paste it 		into “C:\Snort\etc” folder. Overwrite any      existing file.  Remember if you modify your snort.conf file and download a new file, you must modify it for Snort to work.
7.Open a command prompt (cmd.exe) and navigate to folder “C:\Snort\bin” folder. 		( at the Prompt, type cd\snort\bin)
8.To start (execute) snort in sniffer mode use following command:
		snort -dev -i 3
		-i indicates the interface number.  You must pick the correct interface 					number.  In my case, it is 3.
 			-dev is used to run snort to capture packets on your network.
9.To check the interface list,  use following command:
 snort   -W
10.You can tell which interface to use by looking at the Index number and finding Microsoft.  As you can see in the above example, the other interfaces are for VMWare.  My interface is 3.
11.To run snort in IDS mode, you will need to configure the file “snort.conf” according to your network environment.
12.To specify the network address that you want to protect in snort.conf file, look for the following line.
	var HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24  (You will normally see any here)
13. You may also want to set the addresses of DNS_SERVERS, if you have some on your network. Example:

14.Change the RULE_PATH variable to the path of rules folder.
	var RULE_PATH c:\snort\rules

15. Change the path of all library files with the name and path on your system. and you must change the path    of snort_dynamicpreprocessorvariable.
		C:\Snort\lib\snort_dynamiccpreprocessor
You need to do this to all library files in the “C:\Snort\lib” folder. The old path might be: “/usr/local/lib/…”. you will need to    replace that path with your system path.  Using 					C:\Snort\lib
16. Change the path of the “dynamicengine” variable value in the “snort.conf” file..
	Example:  dynamicengine C:\Snort\lib\snort_dynamicengine\sf_engine.dll

17. Add the paths for “include classification.config” and “include reference.config” files.        include c:\Snort\etc\classification.config
		     include c:\Snort\etc\reference.config
18. Remove the comment (#) on the line to allow ICMP rules, if it is  commented with a #.	 include $RULE_PATH/icmp.rules
19. You can also remove the comment of ICMP-info rules comment, if it is commented.
			 include $RULE_PATH/icmp-info.rules
20. To add log files to store alerts generated by snort,  search for the “output log” 			test in snort.conf and add the following line:
			output alert_fast: snort-alerts.ids
21.  Comment (add a #) the  whitelist $WHITE_LIST_PATH/white_list.rules and 		the blacklist 		Change the nested_ip inner , \  to nested_ip inner #, \
22. Comment out (#) following lines:
#preprocessor normalize_ip4
#preprocessor normalize_tcp: ips ecn stream
#preprocessor normalize_icmp4
#preprocessor normalize_ip6
#preprocessor normalize_icmp6
23. Save the “snort.conf” file.
24. To start snort in IDS mode, run the following command:
		snort -c c:\snort\etc\snort.conf -l c:\snort\log -i 3
		(Note: 3 is used for my interface card)
If a log is created, select the appropriate program to open it.  You can use WordPard or NotePad++ to read the file.
To generate Log files in ASCII mode, you can use following command while running snort in IDS mode:
	snort -A console -i3 -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -l c:\Snort\log -K ascii
25. Scan the computer that is running snort from another computer by using PING or 	NMap (ZenMap).
After scanning or during the scan you can check the snort-alerts.ids file in the log folder to insure it is logging properly.  You will see IP address folders appear.
Note: if it gives an error message add comment (#) for following lines in snort.config file.  decompress_swf { deflate lzma } \
    decompress_pdf { deflate }
Snort monitoring traffic –

Snort’s detailed report when scanning has stopped –

Log files – We can also view log files.

Note:  Read the setup and configuration of Snort from Snort.org.  While this is a demo, Snort can be configured thousands of ways to detect and alert you in the event you have malicious activity on your network.  Downloading signatures often is extremely important.

D.Network Sniffing:
Wireshark:
Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education. Wireshark is cross-platform, using the Qt widget toolkit in current releases to implement its user interface, and using pcap to capture packets; it runs on Linux, macOS, BSD, Solaris, some other Unix-like operating systems, and Microsoft Windows.
There is also a terminal-based (non-GUI) version called TShark.
Wireshark is used to capture and analyse packets in network. It is also used as a sniffer, network protocol analyzer, and network analyser. We can also apply specific filter on network traffic to get more filtered data packets.
