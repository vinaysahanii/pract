What are the ways to prevent your data hacked by packet sniffers?
Using HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP will prevent packet sniffers from seeing the traffic on the websites you are visiting.
To make sure you are using HTTPS, check the upper left corner of your browser.
Tunnel your connectivity to a virtual private network, or a VPN. A VPN encrypts the traffic being sent between your computer and the destination. This includes information being used on websites, services, and applications. A packet sniffer would only see encrypted data being sent to your VPN service provider.
